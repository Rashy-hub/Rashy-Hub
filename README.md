<h2 align="center">🎤 About Me</h2>
<h3 align="center">👨‍💻 Web Developer | JavaScript Enthusiast | Versatile Coder 🚀Always ready to adapt and deliver.</h3>

  - 🔭 I’m currently working on a **Next.js** version of my [Portfolio](https://www.underconstructionpage.com/).<br>
  - 🌱 I’m currently learning **.NET/C#**, **ASP.NET**, and **Kubernetes**.<br>
  - 🎨 I work on frontend projects too, but I’ll be honest—**I’m not a designer**! Still, I always do my best to create clean user interfaces.<br>
